EVOLUTION OF HRM ( 5 marks )   
The evolution of the concept of Human Resource Management is presented below 
 Period before industrial revolution – The society was primarily an 
agriculture economy with limited production. Number of specialized crafts was 
limited and was usually carried out within a village or community with 
apprentices assisting the master craftsmen. Communication channel were 
limited. 
 Period of industrial revolution (1750 to 1850) – Industrial revolution marked 
the conversion of economy from agriculture based to industry based. 
Modernization and increased means if communication gave way to industrial 
setup. A department was set up to look into workers wages, welfare and other 
related issues. This led to emergence of personnel management with the major 
task as 
–          Worker’s wages and salaries

–          Worker’s record maintenance 
–          Worker’s  housing facilities and health care 
An important event in industrial revolution was growth of Labour Union (1790)  – 
The works working in the industries or factories were subjected to long working hours 
and very less wages. With growing unrest , workers across  the world started protest 
and this led to the establishment of Labour unions. To deal with labour issues at one 
end and management at the other Personnel Management department had to 
be  capable of politics and diplomacy , thus the industrial relation department 
emerged. 
 Post  Industrial revolution – The term Human resource Management saw a 
major evolution after 1850. Various studies were released and many 
experiments were conducted during this period which gave HRM altogether a 
new meaning and importance. 
A brief overview of major theories release during this period is presented below 
 
Frederick W. Taylor gave principles of scientific management (1857 o 1911) led to 
the evolution of scientific human resource management approach which was 
involved in 
–          Worker’s training 
–          Maintaining wage uniformity 
–          Focus on attaining better productivity. 
 
Hawthorne studies, conducted by Elton Mayo & Fritz Roethlisberger (1927 to 1940). 
– Observations and findings of Hawthrone experiment shifted the focus of Human 
resource from increasing worker’s productivity to increasing worker’s efficiency 
through greater work satisfaction. 
 
Douglas McGregor Theory X and Theory Y (1960) and Abraham Maslow’s 
Hierarchy of needs ( 1954) – These studies and observations led to the transition 
from the administrative and passive Personnel Management approach to a more 
dynamic Human Resource Management approach which considered workers as a 
valuable resource. 
As a result of these principles and studies, Human resource management became 
increasingly line management function , linked to core business operations. Some of 
the major activities of HR department are listed as- 
1. Recruitment and selection of skilled workforce. 
2. Motivation and employee benefits 
3. Training and development of workforce 
4. Performance related salaries and appraisals.

3. To Delegate Authority: 
HR policies make delegation of authority possible, which means assigning the work to 
others and give them authority to do it. HR policies help executives at various levels 
of decision centres to act with confidence without consulting the superiors every time. 
HR policies give a manager liberty to choose the alternatives provided and to decide 
upon the action.

Therefore, each group works for the achievement of the larger objectives of the 
organization without any policy conflicts. Thus, HR policies provide better control. 
5. To Evaluate Efficiency: 
HR policies serve as standards in execution of work. Efficiency of a group may be 
evaluated by its performance in the light of the policy. After assessing whether 
organization has achieved the desired results set in the policy, HR policy may be 
amended or a new policy may be formulated in the light of the actual performance. 
6. To Create Confidence among Employees: 
HR policies provide the workers a security against exploitation and create confidence 
in employees who may know where they stand in the organization. 
7. To Motivate: 
HR policies introduce the employees to the objectives of the organization. It guides 
the workers in achieving the objectives. They work enthusiastically and with loyalty 
to get those objectives. 
8. To Guide the Management: 
HR policies provide guidance to management in relation to the HR problems. HR 
policies decide how to get the work done by the people or how to behave with them.

2. Easy to Understand: Policies should be stated in define, positive, clear and 
understandable language. 
3. Precise: Policies should be sufficiently comprehensive and prescribe limits and 
yardsticks for future action. 
4. Stable as well as Flexible: Personnel policies should be stable enough assure 
people that there will not be drastic overnight changes. They should be flexible 
enough to keep the organization in tune with the times. 
5. Based on Facts: Personnel policies should be built on the basis of facts and sound 
judgment and not in personal feelings or opportunistic decision. 
6. Appropriate Number: There should be as many personnel policies as necessary to 
cover conditions that can be anticipated, but not so many policies as to become 
confusing or meaningless. 
7. Fair & Equitable:- policies should be just fair & equitable to internal as well as 
external groups. Eg:- a policy of recruitment from within may limit opportunities to 
bright candidates from outside & a policy of recruitment from outside only a would 
limit promotional avenue to promising internal candidates.  
8. Reasonable:- policies must be reasonable & capabable of being accomplished. To 
gain acceptance & commitment from employees, the policy should be conditioned by 
the suggestions & reactions of those who are affected by the policy. 
9. Review:- periodic review of policies is essential to keep in tune with changing 
times & a avoid organisational complacency or managerial stagnation.  
BENEFITS OF HRM POLICY  
1. Recruitment and Selection 
Policies pertaining to the recruitment and selection process are the foundation of 
building any workforce. You must have a plan for creating applications, how to 
prequalify applicants, how applicants move up to become a candidate and other 
employment procedures. This set of policies also benefits current employees who 
refer applicants to your business.

2.Training and Professional Development 
Provisions for employee training and development are included in human resource 
policy documents because it informs employees of the kind of professional 
development available to them. In addition, policies related to training and 
development assistance in the formulation of employee development plans or 
performance improvement plans. Training and development policies serve as an 
outline of educational benefits available to current employees. 
3.Handling Employee Concerns 
Many companies have written procedures for handling employee complaints, 
whether they are internal, informal complaints or allegations made about the 
employer to enforcement agencies. The benefit of this policy is to document your 
company’s commitment to non-discriminatory practices and how such complaints 
are resolved. These policies also benefit employees because they provide important 
information about workplace communication in the event an employee is unsure of 
who she contacts to discuss any concerns or problems. 
4.Workplace Safety 
In a time when more than worker safety in the performance of her job is the primary 
issue addressed in safety policies, employers distribute policies that address matters 
such as workplace violence. These types of policies are generally discussed in detail 
with employee groups; an emergency evacuation policy isn’t effective if you don’t 
discuss it until the emergency happens. Another benefit to having a human resources 
safety policy is adherence to federal and state guidelines for workplace safety. 
5.Organizational Structure 
An introduction to the human resources policy manual explains the organizational 
structure, what departments fulfill which expectations and company leadership. In 
the introductory section, many employers also explain the company philosophy as it 
is related to customer service, co-workers, leadership and business ethics. Ethics 
statements are extremely popular, especially in a world where social responsibility is 
observed by so much of the population. This section of a human resources policy 
manual may also state the company's compliance with federal, state and local anti-
discrimination laws. 
6.Employment Rules:- 
Employees are accustomed to learning specific workplace rules such as dress code, 
discipline procedures, parking, attendance and working hours, holidays, employee 
benefits and payroll dates. The human resources policy on these issues is easy 
accessed by employees who have questions, or reviewed by new employees eager to 
learn more about their new employer.

UNIT II 
HUMAN RESOURCE PLANNING 
HUMAN RESOURCE PLANNING 
Meaning:- 
HRP means deciding the number & type of the human resources required for 
each job, unit & the total company for a particular future date in order to carry out 
organisational activities.  
HRP or manpower planning is essentially the process of getting the right 
number of qualified people into the right job at the right time. It is a system matching 
the supply of people(existing employees & those to be hired or searched for) with 
openings the organisation expects over a time frame.  
Definition:-Edwin B.Geisler  “Manpower planning is the process(including 
forecasting, developing, implementing & controlling) by which a firm ensures that is 
has the right number of people & the right kind of people, at the right places, at the 
right time, doing things for which they are economically useful.  
Acc. Bruce P. Coleman “ Manpower planning is the process of determining manpower 
requirements in order to carry out the integrated plan of the organisation”.  
OBJECTIVES/PURPOSES OF HRP 
i. Forecasting Human Requirements: 
HRP Human resource planning is essential to determine the future human resource 
needs in an organization. In the absence of such a plan, it would be difficult to have 
the services of the right kind of people at the right time. 
ii.  Effective Management of Change: 
Proper planning is required to cope with changes in market conditions, technology 
products, and government regulations in an effective way. These changes call for 
continuous allocation or reallocation of skills and in the absence of planning there 
might be under-utilization of human resource. 
iii. Realizing Organizational Goals: 
In order to meet the needs of expansion programmes and growth strategies of the 
organizations planning is essential.

decision making as to the promotional opportunities to be made available for the 
organization. 
 v. Effective Utilisation of Human Resource: 
This database is also useful for identifying surplus and unutilized human resource and 
resources. In times of downsizing or in estimating the cost-benefit analysis of human 
resources would add value to the process. 
The objective of human resource planning is to maintain and improve the 
organization’s ability to achieve its goals by developing strategies that will result in 
optimum contribution of human resources.

1. To forecast the future needs of human resources. 
2. To ensure fuller and effective utilisation of existing human resources. 
3. To ensure that necessary manpower is available as and when required. 
4. To relate human resource planning with the organisational planning. 
5. To estimate the surplus or shortage of human resource in the organisation at any 
given time. 
6. To get information about the manner in which the existing personnel are deployed, 
the kind of skills needed for various jobs, and manpower requirements over a 
specified period of time in relation to the organisational goals. 
7. To anticipate the impact of technology on jobs and human resources. 
8. To determine the levels of recruitment and training. 
9. To estimate the cost of labour force and its housing requirements. 
10. To provide a basis for management development programme. 
11. To meet the needs of expansion and diversification programmes. 
12. To increase the labour productivity and thereby reduce the labour costs.

2.Organisational objectives & Policies:- HR plans need to be based on 
organisational objectives. In practice, this implies that objectives of the HR plans must 
be derived from organisational objectives. Specific requirements in terms of number 
& characteristics of employees should be derived from the organisational objectives. 
3.HR demand forecast:- it is the process of estimating the future quantity & quality 
of people required. The basis of the forecast must be the annual budget & long term 
corporate plan translated into actively levels for each function & department. 
4. HR supply forecast:- Personnel demand analysis provides the manager with the 
means of estimating the number & kind of employees that will be required. The next 
logical step for the management is to determine weather it will be able to procure the 
required number of personnel & the sources for such procurement . this information is 
provided by supply forecasting. Supply forecasting measures the number of people 
likely to be available from within & outside an organisation after making allowance 
for absenteeism, internal movements & promotions, wastage & changes in hours & 
other conditions of work.  
5. HR Programming:-  Once an organization’s personnel & supply are forecast the 
two must be reconciled or balance in order that vacancies can be filled by the right 
employees at the right time. HR programming the third step in the planning process, 
therefore assumes greater importance. 
6. HR Plan Implementation:-  implementation requires converting an HR plan into 
action. A series of action programmes are initiated as a part of HR plan 
implementation. Some such programmes are recruitment, selection & placement, 
training & development, retaining & redeployment the retention plan the succession 
plan & redundancy plan.   
7. Control & Evaluation:- this represents the fifth & final phase in the HRP process. 
The HR plan should include budgets, targets & standards. It should also clarify 
responsibilities for implementation & control & establish reporting procedures, which 
will enable achievements to be monitored against plan. 
                                       JOB ANALYSIS 
Definition:- Job analysis is the process of studying & collecting information relating 
to the operation & responsibilities of a specific job. The immediate products of this 
analysis are job descriptions & job specification.

the jobs. Employees need to be compensated depending on the grades of jobs, 
which they occupy. Remuneration involves fringe benefits, bonus & other 
benefits.

an employee against what is expected to him/her. Such  assessment is the basis 
for awarding promotion, effecting transfers, or assessing training needs.  
 Safety & Health:-  the process of conducting a detailed job analysis provides 
an excellent opportunity to uncover & identify hazardous conditions & 
unhealthy environmental factors (such as heat, noise fumes & dust) so that

SELECTION 
Meaning:-  selection is the process of examining the applicants with regard to their 
suitability  for the given job or jobs, & choosing the best from the suitable candidates 
& rejecting the others.  
Definition:-  Acc. to Dale Yoder, “ Selection is the process in which candidates for 
employment are divided into two classes those who are to be offered employment &

interviewer has a plan of action worked out in relation to time to be devoted to 
each candidate, type of information to be sought, information to be given, the 
modality of interview and so on. He may use the plan with some amount of 
flexibility. 
3. Patterned Interview: This is also a planned interview but planned to a higher 
degree of accuracy, precision and exactitude. A list of questions and areas are

carefully prepared. The interviewer goes down the list of questions, asking 
them one after another. 
4. Non-directive Interview: This is designed to let the interviewee speak his 
mind freely. The interviewer is a careful and patient listener, prodding 
whenever the candidate is silent. The idea is to give the candidate complete 
freedom to ‘sell’ himself without encumbrances of the interviewer’s questions. 
5. Depth Interview: This is designed to intensively examine the candidate’s 
background and thinking and to go into considerable detail on a particular 
subject to special interest to the candidate. The theory behind it is that if the 
candidate is found good in his area of special interest, the chances are high that 
if given a job he would take serious interest in it. 
6. Stress Interview: This is designed to test the candidate and his conduct and 
behaviour by putting him under conditions of stress and strain. This is very 
useful to test the behaviour of individuals under disagreeable and trying 
situations. 
7. Group Interview: This is designed to see how the candidates react to and 
against each other. All the candidates may be brought together in the office and 
they may be interviewed. The candidates may, alternatively, be given a topic 
for discussion and be observed as to who will lead the discussion, how they 
will participate in the discussion, how each will make his presentation and how 
they will react to each other’s views and presentation. 
8. Panel Interview: This is done by members of the interview board or a 
selection committee. This is done usually for supervisory and managerial 
positions. It pools the collective judgement and wisdom of members of the 
panel. The candidate may be asked to meet the panel individually for a fairly 
lengthy interview. 
 
INDUCTION & PLACEMENT 
 PLACEMENT  
Meaning:- Placement is the actual posting of the candidate for the specific job. It 
involves the assigning of specific rank & responsibility to that candidate. 
In other words, Induction is the task of introducing the new employee to the policies, 
procedures, rules & regulations of the organisation.  
Acc. to Pigors & Myers “Placement is the determination of the job to which an 
accepted candidate is to be assigned & the work of that job. It is the match of what the 
supervisor has reason to think he can do with what the job demands”.

2. Organisational Viability and the Transformation process:- the primary 
goals of most of the organisations is that their viability is continuously 
influenced by environmental pressure. If the organisation does not adapt itself 
to the changing factors in the environment, it will lose its market share. If the 
organisation desires to adapt these changes, first it has to train the employees to 
impart specific skills & knowledge in order to enable them to contribute to 
organisational efficiency & to cope with the changing environment.  
 
3. Technical Advances:- Every organisation in order to survive & to be effective 
should adopt the latest technology i.e., mechanisation, computerisation & 
automation. Adoption of latest technological means & methods will not be 
complete until they are manned by employees possessing skills to operate 
them. So, the organisation should train the employees to enrich them in the 
areas of changing technical skills & knowledge from time to time. 
 
4. Organisational Complexity:- with the emergence of increased mechanisation 
& automation, manufacturing of multiple products & by-products or dealing in 
services of diversified lines, extension of operations to various regions of the 
country or in overseas countries, organisation of most of the companies has 
become complex,. This creates the complex problems of coordination & 
integration of activities adaptable for adaptable to the expanding & 
diversifying.  
 
5. Human Relation :- Trends in approach towards personnel management has 
changed from the commodity approach to partnership approach, crossing the 
human relations approach. So today, management of most of the organisation 
has to maintain human relations besides maintaining sound industrial relations 
although hitherto the managers are not accordingly.  
 
 
6. Change in the Job Assignment:- training is also necessary when the existing 
employee in promoted to the higher level in the organisation & when there is 
some new job or occupation due to transfer. Training is also necessary to equip 
old employees with the advanced disciplines, techniques or technology. 
7. The training also need for 
 Increase productivity  
 Improve quality of the products/service.  
 Help a company to fulfil its future personnel needs. 
 Improve organisational climate.

METHODS OF TRAINING  
I – ON THE JOB TRAINING 
This type of Training, also known as job instruction training, is the most commonly 
used method. Under this method, the individual is placed on a regular job & taught the 
skills necessary to perform that job. The trainee learns under the supervision & 
guidance of a qualified worker or instructor. On- the job training  methods includes 
1. Job Instruction Training:- 
This method is also known training step by step. Under this method, the trainer 
explains to the trainee the way of doing the job, Job knowledge & skills & 
allows him to do the job. The trainer appraises the performance of the trainee, 
provides feedback information & corrects the trainee. 
2. Vestibule Training:- 
 In this method, actual work conditions are simulated in a classroom. Material, 
files & equipment which are used in actual job performance are also used in 
training. This type of training is commonly used to training personnel for 
clerical & semi-skilled jobs. The Duration of this training ranges from days to a 
few weeks. Theory can be related to practice in this method. 
3. Simulation:- 
The real situation of work environment in an organisation is presented in the 
training session. In other words, in simulation, instead of taking participants 
into the field, the field is simulated in the training session itself. The 
participants act out samples of real business behaviour in order to get practice 
in making decisions. It covers situations of varying complexities & roles for the 
participants. Role Playing is one of the common simulation methods of 
training. 
4. Job Rotation:-  
 This type of training involves the movement of the trainee from one job to 
another. The trainee receives job knowledge & gains experience from his 
supervisor or trainer in each of the different job assignments. Though this 
method of training is common in training managers for general management 
positions, trainees can also be rotated from job to job in workshop jobs.

                                                          TUMKURU. 
 
 
5. Coaching :-  
The trainee is placed under a particular supervisor who functions as a coach in 
training the individual. The supervisor provides feedback to the trainee on his 
performance & offers him some suggestions for improvements. Often the 
trainee shares some of the duties & responsibilities of the coach & relieves him 
of his burden. A limitation of this method of training it shat the trainee may not 
have the freedom or opportunity to express his own ideas. 
  
6. Apprenticeship:-  
It is a structured process by which people become skilled workers through a 
combination of classroom instructions & on-the-job training. It is widely used 
to train individuals for many occupations. Many organisations have 
apprenticeship laws with supervised plans for such training.  
II OFF-THE-JOB TRAINING 
Under this method o training the trainee is separated from the job situation & his 
attention is focused upon learning the material related to his future job performance. 
Since the trainee is not distracted by job requirements, he can place his entire 
concentration on learning the job rather than spending his time in performing it. There 
is an opportunity for freedom of expression for the trainees.  
Off –the Job Training includes 
1. Lecture Method:-  
The lecture is traditional & direct method so instruction. The instructor 
organises the material & gives it to group of trainees in the form of a talk. To 
be effective, the lecture must motivate & create interest among the trainees. 
Thus, costs & time involved are reduced. The major limitation of the lecture 
method is that it does not provide for transfer of training effectively.  
2. Conference or Discussion:-  
It is a method in training the clerical, professional & supervision personnel. 
This method involves a group of people who pose ideas, examine & share 
facts, ideas & data test assumptions & draw conclusions, all of which 
contribute to the improvement o job performance. Discussion has the distinct 
advantage over the lecture method, in that the discussion involves two-way 
communication & hence, feedback is provided. The participants feel free to 
speak in small groups. The success of this method depends on the  person who 
leads the group.

on a specific concern of the problem. This method increases the trainee’s 
power of observation & also his analytical ability.

in imaginary situations. This method of training involves action, doing & 
practice. The participants play the role of certain characters such as the 
production manager, mechanical engineer, superintendents, maintenance 
engineers, quality control inspectors, foreman, workers & the like. This method 
is mostly used for developing interpersonal interactions & relations.     
5.  Programmed Instruction:  
In recent years, this method has become popular. The subject matter to be 
earned is presented in a series of carefully planned sequential units. These units 
are arranged from simple to more complex levels of instruction. The trainees 
go through these units by answering question or filling the blanks. This method 
is expensive & time consuming.   
6. T- Group or Sensitivity Training:-   
This method aims to influence an individual’s behaviour through group 
discussion. In group discussion, the trainees freely express their ideas, beliefs 
& attitudes. In this method the trainees are enabled to see themselves as others

It consists of a central yellow circle, labeled "Career Planning Process," surrounded by seven interconnected steps arranged in a circular flowchart. Each step is contained within a colored rectangular box, and the steps are connected by arrows indicating the cyclical and iterative nature of the process.

1. **Self-Assessment**: This step is placed at the top in an orange box. It signifies the importance of evaluating one's skills, interests, values, and strengths as the initial step in career planning.
   
2. **Research on Careers**: Directly to the right of Self-Assessment, also in an orange box, this step involves exploring various career options that align with the individual's self-assessed attributes.

3. **Set Career Objectives**: Continuing clockwise, this step, in a light red-orange box, entails defining specific career goals based on the research and self-assessment.

4. **Improve Skills**: In a similarly colored box as Set Career Objectives, it occupies the next position and highlights the need for skill enhancement to meet the defined career goals.

5. **Prepare CV**: This step is in a pinkish-red box, indicating the preparation of a resume that effectively showcases the individual's qualifications and skills.

6. **Search Jobs**: Following in a grey box, this step involves actively looking for job opportunities that match the improved skill set and career objectives.

7. **Revise Career Goals**: Finally, in another grey box at the top left, this step signifies the ongoing nature of the career planning process, encouraging periodic reevaluation and adjustment of career goals based on experiences and changing circumstances.

The interconnected arrows demonstrate the dynamic and continuous aspect of career planning, suggesting that each step is part of an ongoing process that may involve revisiting and refining previous steps. The structured flowchart provides a clear and systematic approach to career planning, emphasizing that it is a continuous process rather than a one-time decision.*

reports. Similarly career planning can be done for the employee on the 
performance 
appraisal

PROCESS OF PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL  
 1. Setting performance standards :- In this very first step in performance 
appraisal the HR department decides the standards of performance i.e. they 
decide what exactly is expected from the employee for each and every job. 
Sometimes certain marking scheme may be adopted eg. A score 90/100 = 
excellent performance, a score of 80/100 = good. And so on.  
2. Communication standard set to the employee :- Standards of 
performance appraisal decided in 1st step are now conveyed to the employee 
so that the employee will know what is expected from him and will be able to 
improve his performance. 
 3. Measuring performance :- The performance of the employee is now 
measure by the HR department, different methods can be used to measure 
performance i.e. traditional and modern method. The method used depends 
upon the company’s convenience.  
4. Comparing performance with standard :- The performance of the 
employee is now judged against the standard. To understand the score 
achieved by him. Accordingly we come to know which category of 
performance the employee falls into i.e. excellent, very good, good, 
satisfactory etc.  
5. Discussing result :- The results obtained by the employee after 
performance appraisal are informed or conveyed to him by the HR 
department. A feedback is given to the employee asking him to change 
certain aspects of his performance and improve them.

improve himself in the areas specified by the HR department. The HR 
department constantly receives or keeps a check on the employee’s 
performance and notes down improvements in performance.

7. Implementation and review :- The performance appraisal policy is to be 
implemented on a regular basis. A review must be done from time to time to 
check whether any change in policy is required. Necessary changes are 
made from time to time.  
METHODS OF PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL  
I.Traditional method  
Traditional approach is also known as traits approach . it is based on the 
evaluation of traits in a person. This system may list ten to fifteen personal 
characteristics such as ability to get in along with people, competence, 
judgement, inititative & leadership etc. 
1. Check list method :-  
In this method the senior, the boss is given a list of questions about the 
junior. These questions are followed by check boxes. The superior has to put 
a tick mark in any one of the boxes This method can be explained with the 
following eg. * Y N Does the employee have leadership qualities?  
*Y N Is the employee capable of group efforts? 
* Y N Has the employee shown analytical skills?  
 2. Confidential report :-  
This method is very popular in government departments to appraise IAS 
officers and other high level officials. In this method the senior or the boss 
writes a report about the junior giving him details about the performance 
about the employee. The +ve and – ve traits, responsibilities handled on the 
job and recommendations for future incentives or promotions. The report is 
kept highly confidential and access to the report is limited. 
3.Critical incident method :-  
In this method critical or important incidents which have taken place on 
this job are noted down along with employee’s behavior and reaction in all 
these situations. Both +ve and –ve incidents are mentioned. This is followed 
by an analysis of the person, his abilities and talent, recommendations for 
the future incentives and promotions. 
4.Ranking method :-  
In this method ranks are given to employees based on their performance. 
There are different methods of ranking employees. Simple ranking method 
Alternate ranking method Paired comparison method

                                                          TUMKURU. 
 
 
 i. Simple ranking method :- Simple ranking method refers to ranks in 
serial order from the best employee eg. If we have to rank 10 best employees 
we start with the first best employee and give him the first rank this is 
followed by the 2nd best and so on until all 10 have been given ranks. 
 ii. Alternate ranking :- In this method the serial alternates between the 
best and the worst employee. The best employee is given rank 1 and then we 
move to the worst employee and give him rank 10 again to 2nd best 
employee and give him rank 2 and so on.  
iii. Paired comparison :- In this method each and every person is the 
group, department or team is compared with every other person in the 
team/group/department. The comparison is made on certain criteria and 
finally ranks are given. This method is superior because it compares each 
and every person on certain qualities and provides a ranking on that basis. 
5.Graphic rating scale :-  
Graphic rating scale refers to using specific factors to appraise people. The 
entire appraisal is presented in the form of a chart. The chart contains 
certain columns which indicate qualities which are being appraised and 
other columns which specify the rank to be given. 
 Eg. Employee A Quality of work Quantity of work Intelligence Excellent Very 
good good satisfactory poor The senior has to put a tick mark for a 
particular quality along with the ranking. Such charts are prepared for every 
employee. According to the department in which they work. Sometimes the 
qualities which are judged may change depending upon the department.  
6.Narrated essay :-  
In this method the senior or the boss is supposed to write a narrative essay 
describing the qualities of his junior. He may describe the employees 
strength and weakness, analytical abilities etc. the narrative essay ends with 
a recommendation for future promotion or for future incentives. Modern 
methods Modern methods of appraisal are being increasingly used by 
companies. Now days one of the striving feature that appraisal involves is, 
the opinion of many people about the employee and in some cases 
psychological test are used to analyze the ability of employee.  
7.Paired Comparisons Method:-   
In this method every person is comared traits-wise, with other person, one 
at a time, the number of times one person is compared with other is tallied 
on a piece o paper. Theses number help in yielding rank order of employees.

                                                          TUMKURU. 
 
 
Example:- if there are five perspn to be compared A’ s performance is first 
compared with that N to find out who has better performance, then A is 
compared with C,D & E in turn & performance is recorded.  
8.Grading System:- 
Under this system certain features like analytical ability, co-opeaativeness, 
dependability, job-knowledge etc are selected for evaluation  the employees 
are given grades according to the judgement of the rater. The grades may be 
such as 
A-Outstanding 
B-very Good 
C-Satisfactory 
D-Average 
E-Below average etc. 
9.Forced Distribution method:- 
Some raters suffer from a constant error i.e. they rate of employees as only 
good, average or poor. They thus do not evaluate the employees properly.  
This system minimises rater’s bias so that all employees are not similarly 
rated. This system is based on presumption that all employees can be 
divided into five categories i.e. Outstanding, Above average, Average, Below 
average & poor.  
10.Nominations:- 
Under the nominations method, appraisers are asked to identify the 
exceptionally good & exceptionally poor performers, who are then singled 
out for special treatment.  
11.Work  Sample Tests:- 
 In this method, employees are given from time to time, work related tests 
which are then evaluated. 
II. Modern method  
1. Assessment centers :-  
Assessment centers (AC) are places where the employee’s are assessed on 
certain qualities talents and skills which they possess. This method is used 
for selection as well as for appraisal. The people who attend assessment

                                                          TUMKURU. 
 
 
centers are given management games, psychological test, puzzles, 
questioners about different management related situations etc. based on 
their performance in these test an games appraisal is done.  
2. Management by objective :-  
This method was given by Petter Druckard in 1974. It was intended to be a 
method of group decision making. It can be use for performance appraisal 
also. In this method all members of the of the department starting from the 
lowest level employee to the highest level employee together discus, fix target 
goals to be achieved, plan for achieving these goals and work together to 
achieve them. The seniors in the department get an opportunity to observe 
their junior- group efforts, communication skills, knowledge levels, interest 
levels etc. based on this appraisal is done. 
3. Behavioral anchored rating scale :- (BARS) 
In this method the appraisal is done to test the attitude of the employee 
towards his job. Normally people with +ve approach or attitude view and 
perform their job differently as compared to people with a –ve approach.  
4. Human resource audit/accounting :- 
 In this method the expenditure on the employee is compared with the 
income received due to the efforts of the employee. A comparison is made to 
find out the utility of the employee to the organization. The appraisal 
informs the employee about his contribution to the company and what is 
expected in future.  
5. 360 Degree Performance  appraisal :-  
In this method of appraisal and all round approach is adopted. Feedback 
about the employee is taken from the employee himself, his superiors, his 
juniors, his colleagues, customers he deals with, financial institutions and 
other people he deals with etc. Based on all these observations an appraisal 
is made and feedback is given. This is one of the most popular methods.  
LIMITATIONS OF PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL  
1. Halo effect :- In this case the superior appraises the person on certain 
positive qualities only. The negative traits are not considered. Such an 
appraisal will no give a true picture about the employee. And in some cases 
employees who do not deserve promotions may get it.  
2. Horn effect :- In this case only the negative qualities of the employee are 
considered and based on this appraisal is done. This again will not help the

organization because such appraisal may not present a true picture about 
the employee.  
3. Central tendency :- In this case the superior gives an appraisal by giving 
central values. This prevents a really talented employee from getting 
promotions he deserves and some employees who do not deserve any thing 
may get promotion.  
4. Leniency and strictness :- Some bosses are lenient in grading their 
employees while some are very strict. Employee who really deserves 
promotions may loose the opportunity due to strict bosses while those who 
may not deserve may get benefits due to lenient boss.  
5. Spill over effect :- In this case the employee is judged +vely or –vely by 
the boss depending upon the past performance. Therefore although the 
employee may have improved performance, he may still not get the benefit.  
6. Fear of loosing subordinates and spoiling relations :- Many bosses do 
not wish to spoil their relations with their subordinates. Therefore when 
they appraise the employee they may end up giving higher grades which are 
not required. This is a n injustice to really deserving employees.  
7. Goodwill and techniques to be used :- Sometimes a very strict appraisal 
may affect the goodwill between senior and junior. Similarly when different 
departments in the same company use different methods of appraisal it 
becomes very difficult to compare employees. 8. Paper work and personal 
biased :- Appraisal involves a lot of paper work. Due to this the work load of 
HR department increases. Personal bias and prejudice result in bosses 
favoring certain people and not favoring others.  
COMPENSATION MANAGEMENT 
Meaning:-  Compensation Managemetn is the act of providing monetary 
value to an employee for the work they do by means of a company process 
or policy. Some types of compensation include salary, bonuses & benefit 
packages. 
Acc. to D.S.  Beach “ the establishment &  implementation of sound 
policies & practices of employee compensation. It includes such areas as job 
evaluation, surveys of wage & salaries, analsis of revelvant organisational 
problems, development & maintenance of wage structure, establishing rules

Importance of Compensation Management 
A good compensation is a must for every business organization, as it gives an 
employee a reason to stick to the company. 
An organization gains from a structured compensation management in the following 
ways − 
 
It tries to give proper refund to the employees for their contributions to the organization. 
 
It discovers a positive control on the efficiency of employees and motivates them to perform better 
and achieve the specific standards. 
 
It creates a base for happiness and satisfaction of the workforce that limits the labor turnover and 
confers a stable organization. 
 
It enhances the job evaluation process, which in return helps in setting up more realistic and 
achievable standards. 
 
It is designed to abide with the various labor acts and thus does not result in conflicts between the 
employee union and the management. This creates a peaceful relationship between the employer 
and the employees. 
 
It excites an environment of morale, efficiency and cooperation among the workers and ensures 
satisfaction to the workers. 
 
 
 
 
COMPONENTS OF COMPENSATIOIN MANAGEMENT 
1. Wage:-  wage is general term referring to direct monetary 
compensation. It is also used specifically to refer to payments to 
service workers on the basis of hourly rated production.   
2. Salary:-  salary refers to weekly or monthly rates paid to clerical, 
administrative & professional employees.  
3. Allowances:- Allowances can be defined as the amount of something 
that is allowed, especially within a set of rules and regulations or for a 
specified purpose. Various allowances are paid in addition to basic 
pay. 
Some of these allowances are as follows − 
 Dearness Allowance − This allowance is given to protect real income 
of an employee against price rise. Dearness allowance (DA) is paid as 
a percentage of basic pay.

 House Rent Allowance − Companies who do not provide living 
accommodation to their employees pay house rent allowance (HRA) to 
employees. This allowance is calculated as a percentage of salary. 
 City Compensatory Allowance − This allowance is paid basically to 
employees in metros and other big cities where cost of living is 
comparatively more. City compensatory allowance (CCA) is normally 
a fixed amount per month, like 30 per cent of basic pay in case of 
government employees. 
 Transport Allowance/Conveyance Allowance − Some companies 
pay transport allowance (TA) that accommodates travel from the 
employee’s house to the office. A fixed amount is paid every month to 
cover a part of traveling expenses. 
Incentives and Performance Based Pay 
Incentive compensation is performance-related remuneration paid with a 
view to encourage employees to work hard and do better. 
Both individual incentives and group incentives are applicable in most 
cases. Bonus, gain-sharing, commissions on sales are some examples of 
incentive compensation. 
Fringe Benefits/Perquisites 
Fringe benefits include employee benefits like medical care, hospitalization, 
accident relief, health and group insurance, canteen, uniform, recreation 
and the likes. 
FACTORS AFFECTING WAGES & SALARY  
The factors can be catergorised into 
I.External Factors:-  
 External factors are 
1.Demand & Supply:-  the labour market conditions or demand & supply 
forces operate at the national & local leels & determine organisational wage 
structure. When the demand for a particular type of labour is more & 
supply is less then the wages will be more. On the other hand, if supply of 
labour is more & demand on the other hand is less rhen persons will be 
available at lower wage rates. 
2. Cost of Living:-  the wage rates are directly influenced by cost of living of 
a place. The workers will accept a wage which may ensure them a minimum 
standard of living. Wages will also be adjusted according to price index 
number. The increase in price index will erode the purchasing power of 
workers & they will demand higher wages. Wen the prices are stable then 
frequent may not be undertaken.  
3.Trade Union’s Bargaining Power:-  the wage rates are also influenced by 
the bargaining power of trade unions. Stronger the trade union higher will

be the wage rates. The strength of a trade union is judged by its 
membership, financial position & type of leadership. Union’s last weapon is 
strike which may also be used for getting wage increases. 
4.Government Legislation:-  to improve the working conditions of workers, 
government may pass a legislation for fixing minimum wages of workers. 
This may ensure them a minimum level of living. In underdeveloped 
countries bargaining power of labour is weak & employers try to exploit 
workers by paying them low wages. 
5.Psychological 
& 
social 
factors:- 
psychologically 
the 
level 
of 
compensation is perceived as a measure of success in life. Management 
should take into consideration the psychological needs of the employees 
while fixing the wage rates so that the employees take pride in their work. 
Sociologically & ethically, the employees want  that the wage system should 
be equitable. Sociologically & ethically, the employees want that the wage 
system should be equitable, just & fair.  
6.Economy:-  economy also has its impact n wage & salary fixation. Whilc 
it may be possible for some organisations to thrive in a recession, there is 
no doubt that economy affects remuneration decisions. A depressed 
economy will probably increase the labour supply. This, in turn should 
lower the going wage rate. 
7.Technonological Development:-  with the rapid growth of industries, 
there is a shortage of skilled resources. The technological developments 
have been affecting skill levels at faster rates. Thus, the wage rates of skilled 
employees constantly change & an organisation has to keep its level upto 
the mark to suit the market needs.  
8.Prevailing  Market Rates:-  No enterprise can ignore prevailing or 
comparative wage rates. The wage rates paid in the industry or other 
concerns at the same place will form a base for fixing wage rates. If a 
concern pays rates then workers leave their jobs whenever they get a job 
somewhere else. It will  not be possible to retain good workers for long.  
II. INTERNAL FACTORS 
1.Ability to pay:-  the ability to pay of an enterprise will influence wage 
rates to be paid. If the concern is running into losses then it may not be 
able to pay higher wage rate. A profitable concern may pay more to attract 
good workers. During the period of prosperity, workers are paid higher 
wages because management wants to share the profits with labour. 
2.Job Requirements:- Basic wages depend largely on the difficulty level & 
physical & mental effort required in  a particular job. The relative worth of a 
job can be estimated through job evaluation. Simple, routine tasks that can 
be done by many people with minimum skills receive relatively low pay. On 
the other hand, complex, challenging tasks that can be done by few people 
with high skill levels generally receive high pay.

3. Management Strategy:-  the overall strategy which a company pursues 
should determine the remuneration to its employees. Where the strategy of

remuneration level needs to be average or even below average.

increases whereas management prefers performance to effect pay increases.
